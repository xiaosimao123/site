While my previous posts on the Singapore census data focused mainly on the distribution of religious beliefs, there are many interesting trends that could be observed on other characteristics. I decided to pool the data which I have cleaned and processed into a Shiny app. Took a little longer than I expected but it is done. Have fun with it and hope you learn a little bit more about Singapore!

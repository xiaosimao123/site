<TLDR>

Working with content data (e.g. Markdown files or CMS) is a surprisingly difficult and laborious task when developing modern sites (e.g. with Next.js). Contentlayer is a <Dashed label="content SDK" tooltip="A content SDK simplifies working with structured content as data in your site/application" /> that aims to make content easy for developers with a focus on great DX and performance.

We're very excited to officially release Contentlayer in beta after many months of alpha testing and already being used in over 300 projects.

## Motivation: Thinking of Content as Data

How we build content-driven web experiences [has evolved significantly](/blog/working-with-content-is-hard-for-developers) over the past three decades. From monolithic CMSs (like Wordpress) over template-based site generators (like Jekyll) to modern web frameworks (like Next.js).

While developers gained more flexibility in the way they can design and structure their site - it also came at the cost of having to take responsibility over how to process and serve the content.

<ContentStack
  content={{ icons: ['markdown', 'contentful'], label: 'Local/Remote Content' }}
  processor={{ icons: ['question'], label: 'Custom Content Processor' }}
  pages={{ icons: ['react'], label: 'React Pages' }}
  decoupled={true}
/>

Since most modern site frameworks (like Next.js, Remix etc) are "content agnostic", it's the responsibility of the developer to provide the **content as data** to the application in order to render it. This either means consuming the content data from an API (e.g. when using a headless CMS) or doing some form of manual **content pre-processing** which converts the raw content files (e.g. Markdown) into JSON data.

This content pre-processing step can be surprisingly difficult as the following example illustrates.

### DIY Example with Next.js + Markdown

Let's look at a concrete example without Contentlayer (see [source on GitHub](https://github.com/contentlayerdev/contentlayer-benchmarks/tree/main/next-remark)). When building a website using Next.js with local Markdown files as your content source, youâ€™d have to develop a mechanism that converted those Markdown files into data that you could use in your Next.js pages.

- Add support for more content sources (e.g. [Contentful](https://github.com/contentlayerdev/contentlayer/issues/173), [Notion](https://github.com/contentlayerdev/contentlayer/issues/174), ...) and even supporting [multiple content sources](https://github.com/contentlayerdev/contentlayer/issues/84) in a single project
- Providing seamless integrations for more site frameworks (such as [Vite](https://github.com/contentlayerdev/contentlayer/issues/179), [Remix](https://github.com/contentlayerdev/contentlayer/issues/169), [Astro](https://github.com/contentlayerdev/contentlayer/issues/171), ...)
- Validate and evolve the core abstractions of Contentlayer to avoid breaking changes after the 1.0 release
